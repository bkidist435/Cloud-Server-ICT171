Project Steps

1. Launching the EC2 Instance

To begin, I launched a **free-tier EC2 instance** using Ubuntu 20.04 on Amazon Web Services.

Steps:

```bash
# Launch EC2 via AWS Console
# Select: Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (t2.micro)
# Configure Security Group with these inbound rules:
# - SSH (port 22)
# - HTTP (port 80)
# - HTTPS (port 443)
```

After launching, I downloaded my `.pem` key and connected using:

```bash
chmod 400 my-key.pem
ssh -i my-key.pem ubuntu@<your-ec2-ip>
```

2. Installing Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP Stack)
   

How I Installed the LAMP Stack on Ubuntu (EC2)

To host my Grace and Light website, I used a **LAMP stack** on an **Ubuntu EC2 instance**. Here's exactly how I set it up:

1. Update the Package Index

```bash
sudo apt update
```

2. Install Apache Web Server

Apache is the web server that handles HTTP requests.

```bash
sudo apt install apache2
```

To check if it's working, visit your EC2 Public IP (e.g., `http://54.xx.xx.xx`) â€” you should see the Apache default page.

3. Adjust the Firewall

I allowed HTTP traffic on the server:

```bash
sudo ufw allow in "Apache Full"
```

4. Install MySQL

MySQL is the database where WordPress stores its data.

```bash
sudo apt install mysql-server
```

Then run the secure installation script:

```bash
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

I followed the prompts to set a root password and secure the database setup.

5. Install PHP

PHP is the language WordPress is built with.

```bash
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
```

Check version to confirm install:

```bash
php -v
```

### 6. Test Apache with PHP

I created a PHP test file:

```bash
sudo nano /var/www/html/info.php
```

Add this inside:

```php
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```

Then visit: `http://your-ec2-ip/info.php` to confirm PHP is working.

Let me know when you're ready to add the next part (like WordPress install, domain connection, or SSL).

3. Setting Up WordPress

After setting up the LAMP stack, I installed WordPress manually to power my **Grace and Light** site. Here's how I did it:

1. Create a MySQL Database and User for WordPress

I logged into MySQL:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

Then I created the database and user:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE graceandlight_db DEFAULT CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_unicode_ci;
CREATE USER 'graceuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your-strong-password';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON graceandlight_db.* TO 'graceuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

2. Download and Configure WordPress

I moved to the `/tmp` directory and downloaded WordPress:

```bash
cd /tmp
curl -O https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
tar -xvzf latest.tar.gz
```

Then I copied it to the web root:

```bash
sudo cp -a wordpress/. /var/www/html
```

3. Set the Correct Permissions

I gave ownership of the WordPress files to the Apache user:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
sudo find /var/www/html/ -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \;
sudo find /var/www/html/ -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \;
```

4. Configure Apache for WordPress

I created a config file for my domain:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-available/graceandlight.space.conf
```

Then added:

```apache
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName graceandlight.space
    ServerAlias www.graceandlight.space
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html

    <Directory /var/www/html>
        AllowOverride All
    </Directory>

    ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log
    CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined
</VirtualHost>
```

Enabled the site and rewrite module:

```bash
sudo a2ensite graceandlight.space.conf
sudo a2enmod rewrite
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### 5. Complete WordPress Setup via Browser

I visited `http://graceandlight.space` in the browser.

This opened the **WordPress setup wizard**, where I entered:

* Site title: `Grace and Light`
* Username: (admin user I chose)
* Password: (secure password)
* Email: (mine)

Done! WordPress was installed and my site was live.

---

5. Connecting a Domain Name

I purchased the domain graceandlight.space via Namecheap.

To point it to my server:

* I added an **A Record** in Namecheapâ€™s DNS settings:

  * Host: `@`
  * Value: `<my-ec2-public-ip>`
  * TTL: Automatic

Optional:

* Added a **CNAME**:

  * Host: `www`
  * Value: `graceandlight.space`

After DNS propagated, I could visit my site at:
[https://graceandlight.space](https://graceandlight.space)**

---

6. Installing SSL (HTTPS)

To secure the website with HTTPS, I used **Certbot**:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
sudo certbot --apache
```

During setup:

* I selected my domain (`graceandlight.space`)
* Chose the option to redirect HTTP to HTTPS

Now my website is fully secure with a green lock! ðŸ”’
