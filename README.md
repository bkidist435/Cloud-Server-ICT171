Ah! Thanks for the clarification â€” you're looking for a **step-by-step script or content** to include in your **GitHub `README.md`** to document each of the 5 key stages below using your own *Grace and Light* site as the example.

I'll give you clean, copy-paste ready Markdown content for each section, ideal for your GitHub documentation:

## ðŸš€ Project Steps

### ðŸ”¹ 1. Launching the EC2 Instance

To begin, I launched a **free-tier EC2 instance** using Ubuntu 20.04 on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/).

Steps:

```bash
# Launch EC2 via AWS Console
# Select: Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS (t2.micro)
# Configure Security Group with these inbound rules:
# - SSH (port 22)
# - HTTP (port 80)
# - HTTPS (port 443)
```

After launching, I downloaded my `.pem` key and connected using:

```bash
chmod 400 my-key.pem
ssh -i my-key.pem ubuntu@<your-ec2-ip>
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 2. Installing Apache, MySQL, and PHP (LAMP Stack)
To download both MYSQL and PHP (LampStack on Ubuntu I followed this site:

(https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-lamp-stack-on-ubuntu)

Once connected to the EC2 instance via SSH:

```bash
# Update packages
sudo apt update

# Install Apache Web Server
sudo apt install apache2

# Install MySQL Database Server
sudo apt install mysql-server

# Install PHP and required extensions
sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql
```

To check that Apache installed correctly, I visited my EC2 public IP in the browser and saw the Apache welcome page.

---

### ðŸ”¹ 3. Setting Up WordPress

I installed WordPress in the `/var/www/html` directory:

```bash
cd /var/www/html
sudo rm index.html
sudo wget https://wordpress.org/latest.tar.gz
sudo tar -xvzf latest.tar.gz
sudo mv wordpress/* .
sudo rm -rf wordpress latest.tar.gz
```

Then, I set the proper file permissions:

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html
```

---

### ðŸ”¹ 4. Creating the Database and Configuring WordPress

Inside the MySQL shell:

```bash
sudo mysql
```

```sql
CREATE DATABASE wordpress;
CREATE USER 'wpuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'securepassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON wordpress.* TO 'wpuser'@'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
EXIT;
```

Then I configured WordPress to connect to this database:

```bash
sudo cp wp-config-sample.php wp-config.php
sudo nano wp-config.php
```

I updated these lines:

```php
define( 'DB_NAME', 'wordpress' );
define( 'DB_USER', 'wpuser' );
define( 'DB_PASSWORD', 'securepassword' );
```

Restart Apache:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

Now when I visited my public IP, the WordPress setup screen appeared!

---

### ðŸ”¹ 5. Connecting a Domain Name

I purchased the domain **graceandlight.space** via Namecheap.

To point it to my server:

* I added an **A Record** in Namecheapâ€™s DNS settings:

  * **Host**: `@`
  * **Value**: `<my-ec2-public-ip>`
  * **TTL**: Automatic

Optional:

* Added a **CNAME**:

  * **Host**: `www`
  * **Value**: `graceandlight.space`

After DNS propagated, I could visit my site at:
ðŸ”— **[https://graceandlight.space](https://graceandlight.space)**

---

### ðŸ”¹ 6. Installing SSL (HTTPS)

To secure the website with HTTPS, I used **Certbot**:

```bash
sudo apt install certbot python3-certbot-apache
sudo certbot --apache
```

During setup:

* I selected my domain (`graceandlight.space`)
* Chose the option to redirect HTTP to HTTPS

Now my website is fully secure with a green lock! ðŸ”’
